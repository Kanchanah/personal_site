I started this blog as a medium to discuss some statistical, machine learning and deep learning techniques I have learnt and been learning in the past two years as a Graduate Student. My journey so far has been an amazing one and I am hoping to learn more in the years to come.

**I just started off blogging and writing up on what I have learnt so it wll probably take me a few weeks to update everything. Hope to get things up as soon as possible**
